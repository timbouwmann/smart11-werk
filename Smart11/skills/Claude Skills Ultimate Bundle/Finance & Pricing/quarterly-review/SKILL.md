# Quarterly Review

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Conduct a structured quarterly business review
- Analyze performance against goals and OKRs
- Identify what worked, what did not, and what to adjust
- Set priorities and goals for the next quarter

**DO NOT** use this skill for weekly check-ins, annual planning, or financial-only reports. This is for comprehensive quarterly business reviews.

## Core Principle

A QUARTERLY REVIEW IS NOT A REPORT CARD — IT IS A STRATEGIC RECALIBRATION. THE GOAL IS TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT, NOT JUST DOCUMENT WHAT HAPPENED.

---

## Phase 1: Gather Data

### Required Inputs

| Input | What to Ask | Default |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Quarter** | "Which quarter are you reviewing? (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 + year)" | Previous quarter |
| **Goals set for this quarter** | "What were your goals or OKRs for this quarter?" | No default — must be provided |
| **Key metrics** | "What are your core business metrics? (revenue, customers, growth, etc.)" | Revenue, customers, profit |
| **Revenue this quarter** | "What was total revenue this quarter?" | No default — must be provided |
| **Biggest wins** | "What were the top 3 wins this quarter?" | No default — must be provided |
| **Biggest challenges** | "What were the top 3 challenges or failures?" | No default — must be provided |

**GATE: Do not proceed without quarterly goals and actual results.**

| [Goal 2] | [Target] | [Actual] | Hit / Missed / Partial | |
| [Goal 3] | [Target] | [Actual] | Hit / Missed / Partial | |

**Goals hit:** [X] of [X] ([X]%)

### Financial Summary
| Metric | This Quarter | Last Quarter | QoQ Change | YTD |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----|

```
## [Next Quarter] Priorities

### Risks to Monitor

```

## Example: Solo Consultant Q4 Review

**Goals:** 1) Hit $45K revenue (Actual: $42K — 93%), 2) Launch group coaching (Done — 8 enrolled), 3) Reduce client concentration below 40% (Missed — top client still 48%).

**Key win:** Group coaching launched and immediately profitable at $2,400/month recurring.
**Key challenge:** Over-reliance on one client creates risk. Plan for Q1: add 2 new clients to reduce concentration to 35%.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping the review entirely** — the quarter ends and you jump into the next one without reflection. Dedicate 2-3 hours to this.
- **All numbers, no narrative** — metrics without interpretation are just data. Explain what drove the numbers.
- **Setting the same goals after missing them** — if you missed a goal, analyze why. Either adjust the goal, change the approach, or remove it.
- **Too many goals** — 3-5 goals per quarter maximum. More than that dilutes focus.
- **No accountability mechanism** — write the review down and share it with someone (advisor, mastermind, partner) for accountability.

---

## Recovery

- **No goals were set last quarter:** Use this review to establish a baseline. Set 3 goals for next quarter and commit to reviewing them.
- **Terrible quarter (everything missed):** Focus on root causes, not symptoms. One bad quarter is a data point. Two bad quarters is a pattern that needs strategic change.
- **No financial tracking:** Use bank statements to reconstruct revenue and expenses. Set up proper tracking for next quarter.
- **Solo founder with no one to review with:** Write the review anyway. The act of documenting forces clarity. Share with a mentor, advisor, or mastermind group.
