# Expense Policy

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create an expense reimbursement policy for your team or company
- Define spending limits, approval workflows, and acceptable expenses
- Establish receipt requirements and reimbursement timelines
- Document travel, meals, and entertainment expense rules

**DO NOT** use this skill for budgeting (use budget-planner), accounting setup (use bookkeeping-setup), or personal expense tracking. This is for company expense policies.

## Core Principle

A GOOD EXPENSE POLICY EMPOWERS EMPLOYEES TO SPEND WISELY WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION FOR EVERY COFFEE — CLEAR LIMITS, SIMPLE RULES, FAST REIMBURSEMENT.

---

## Phase 1: Company Context

### Required Inputs

| Input | What to Ask | Default |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Company size** | "How many people will this policy cover?" | 1-10 |
| **Team structure** | "Who approves expenses? (founder, managers, self-approval under threshold)" | Founder approves all |
| **Common expenses** | "What do people typically expense? (software, travel, meals, supplies)" | Software, meals, supplies |
| **Budget constraints** | "Any hard spending limits?" | Reasonable and necessary standard |
| **Reimbursement method** | "How do you reimburse? (payroll, direct deposit, corporate card)" | Direct deposit |
| **Remote or in-office** | "Is your team remote, in-office, or hybrid?" | Remote |

**GATE: Do not proceed without company size and common expense types.**

---

## Phase 2: Policy Framework

## Phase 4: Policy Document

### Final Policy Template

```
## [Company Name] Expense Reimbursement Policy

### Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for business expenses incurred by
[Company] team members. The policy ensures expenses are reasonable,
properly documented, and reimbursed promptly.

### Scope
Applies to all full-time employees, part-time employees, and
authorized contractors of [Company].

[Insert Phase 2 categories and limits]
[Insert Phase 3 rules and procedures]

### Policy Violations
Violations include submitting personal expenses, falsifying receipts,
or repeatedly exceeding limits without approval. Violations may result
in delayed reimbursement, repayment requirements, or disciplinary action.

### Policy Updates
This policy is reviewed [annually]. Changes communicated [30] days
before taking effect.

### Acknowledgment
I have read and understood this expense policy.

Name: _______________
Date: _______________
Signature: _______________

## Example: 8-Person Remote Startup

**Key provisions:** Self-approval under $50, founder approval over $50. Software under $50/mo self-approved. $500/year professional development budget. Home office stipend of $500 one-time for new hires. Monthly meal allowance of $100 for team events. Receipts required over $25. Reimbursed with bi-weekly payroll.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **No policy at all** — "just be reasonable" works until someone expenses a $300 dinner. Write it down.
- **Overly restrictive** — requiring approval for a $10 Uber ride wastes everyone's time. Set sensible thresholds.
- **Slow reimbursement** — employees floating company expenses for 60+ days breeds resentment. Reimburse within 2 weeks.
- **Inconsistent enforcement** — if the policy applies to everyone, enforce it for everyone. Including founders.
- **No per-diem option for travel** — per-diem rates eliminate receipt-chasing for meals during travel. Consider offering it.

---

## Recovery

- **No expense tracking system:** Start with a shared spreadsheet template. Upgrade to expense software (Expensify, Ramp) when team exceeds 10 people.
- **Team already has bad habits:** Announce the new policy with a 30-day grace period. After that, enforce consistently.
- **Contractors vs. employees:** Contractor expenses should be included in their contract rate, not reimbursed separately, unless the contract specifies otherwise.
- **International team:** Set per-diem rates by country and accept expenses in local currency with conversion at time of purchase.
